MiniCollage
---
Each art work have different compositions, which is a challenge when aligning the heads to fit inside the mini collages, so each character and each pose have float values inside the roster_data.json that tell MiniCollage how to align each image to fit within the frames.
```json
        "alignMiniCollageImageTop1": 0,
        "alignMiniCollageImageLeft1": 0,
        "alignMiniCollageImageTop2": 0,
        "alignMiniCollageImageLeft2": 0,
        "alignMiniCollageImageTop3": 0,
        "alignMiniCollageImageLeft3": 0
```
replace 0 with any floating number, such as 17.5
